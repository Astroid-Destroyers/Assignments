                Make a website where people can create personalized diet and workout based on their body composition and
                information based on AI responses. For addition features we can make it more accessible or user friendly
                we
                can add features like choosing if they are vegetarian or diet preferences, workout preferences and how
                many
                days they can work out in a week and their goal.
