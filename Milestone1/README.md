What’s it about:
	To make a website where people can create personalized diet and workout based on their body composition and information based on AI responses. For additional features we can make it more accessible or user friendly. We can add features like choosing if they are vegetarian or diet preferences, workout preferences and how many days they can work out in a week and their goal. The additional features are good to have, but the core idea. Or an app for personalized diets and workout plans based on AI.

Main Goal:
Maintaining a healthy lifestyle is difficult because most people struggle with:
   • Knowing what diet best fits their body composition, preferences, and goals. 
   • Finding workouts that match their schedule, fitness level, and dietary restrictions. 
   • Staying consistent without personalized feedback or adjustments.

.
Christian Rusanovsky: Learn how to implement a AI assistant into a app and have it interact with the users profile. I also want to learn how to use NEXT JS since its something I have never used before. I am also excited to use tools like HeroUI since I've only used things like bootstrap before.
