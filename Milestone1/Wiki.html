        <h4>What it is about: </h2>
            <p>
                Make a website where people can create personalized diet and workout based on their body composition and
                information based on AI responses. For addition features we can make it more accessible or user friendly
                we
                can add features like choosing if they are vegetarian or diet preferences, workout preferences and how
                many
                days they can work out in a week and their goal.
                The additional features are good to haves, but the core idea. Or app for personalized diets and workout
                plans based on AI.
            </p>
            <p>Maintaining a healthy lifestyle is difficult because most people struggle with:<br>
                • Knowing what diet best fits their body composition, preferences, and goals.<br>
                • Finding workouts that match their schedule, fitness level, and dietary restrictions.<br>
                • Staying consistent without personalized feedback or adjustments.
